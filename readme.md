# ChatBot Clone by TeamGPT
A simple web-based chatbot implementation using Google's Gemini Language Learning Model (LLM) for natural conversation capabilities. This project was developed in collaboration by students of Web3Bridge Web2 Advance Program.

## Real-time chat interface
* Integration with Gemini LLM API
* Responsive web design
* Simple and intuitive user interface
* Dynamic message handling

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
> HTML5 creates the foundation of the chatbot. It builds the basic structure, sets up the input form, organizes the content, and ensures the chat is accessible to everyone.
* CSS3
> CSS3 took care of how everything looks and feels. It arranges the layout, adds smooth animations when messages appear, makes sure everything fits on different screen sizes, and styles all the chat elements to look appealing.
* JavaScript (Vanilla)
> We used JavaScript to handle all the behind-the-scenes work. It processes what you type, communicates with Google's LLM, updates the chat display, and manages how messages flow through the system.
* Gemini LLM API
> Using the Gemini API as our API provider in the chatbot involved sending users' text input as a prompt to the API and then displaying the API's response back to the user within the chat interface.
